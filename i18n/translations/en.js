Place the heel of one hand on the center of the chest\n3. Place the other hand on top and interlock your fingers\n4. Press down hard and fast (100-120 compressions per minute)\n5. After 30 compressions, give 2 rescue breaths if trained\n6. Continue until help arrives or the person starts breathing\n\nNote: This is general advice. For proper CPR training, please take a certified course.",

Place one foot between their feet for balance\n4. Make a fist with one hand, thumb side in\n5. Place just above their belly button\n6. Grasp your fist with your other hand\n7. Give quick, upward thrusts (Heimlich maneuver)\n8. Continue until object is expelled or person becomes unconscious\n\nCall emergency services if the obstruction isn't cleared quickly.",

Once bleeding stops, secure the dressing with a bandage\n\nSeek emergency care if:\n- Bleeding is severe\n- Blood is spurting\n- Bleeding doesn't stop after 10 minutes of pressure\n- The wound is deep, large, or caused by a serious injury",
